# Rhythm Arcade game

This is a Rhythm arcade machine. You can play a cool rythm game with it, and get FREE TICTACs!

It uses an esp32, 7-segment display, a few buttons and neopixels (WS2812B).

## Why we made it?

We made this project for Undercity, a hardware hackathon in SF, CA. The goal was to make a fun game that people could play and to have a fun time making it.

## Problems with the design and construction
- LONG printing queue for the 3d printers
- Failed 3d print of the case, we were unable to reprint it in time
- the wires breaking and disconnecting
- the buttons not working properly
- the neopixels not lighting up properly
- the code not working properly
